This is the final exam for student number: **50777481**.  Confirm your student number is correct before proceeding.  **Do not complete someone else's exam.** 


# Instructions

The exam is "open book", you can reference any resources from the class or online to work through the questions. However, all the work MUST be in your own words. You can not copy from online resources or classmates. Plagiarism will be taken very seriously and could result in failing the exam.

The exam will be open for 24 hours, but it shouldn't take you more than a few hours to complete.  You only have one attempt to take the exam during the exam.  The exam has **three parts**: a written response section, a flowchart section, and a mixed questions.  You will save each part as a separate document and upload it to exam page on canvas.

If you experience extenuating circumstances during the exam you may reach out to me, but I will not be answering any questions related to the content of the exam during the exam period. Do not contact your TAs about the exam, they will not be answering any questions during the exam period.

Good Luck!


# Written Responses

This section consists of an essay and a handful of short answer questions.

* For your written section, type up your essay and short answers response and save them **in one document** as .pdf.  Name the file: **StudentNumber_WrittenRespones.pdf**
    * If your student number were "10011001", your file would be named: **10011001_WrittenRespones.pdf**


## Essay

Pick **one** of the essays below to answer.  Make sure to list the number of the essay you are choosing to answer.  Feel free to include diagrams/figures/sketches if applicable, but do not feel obligated to do so.



### Coordinate Systems

In Module 2, you created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the steps necessary to create a 2D representation of the earth (or a specific region of the earth) in a GIS and what are the simplifications made at each step?  Discuss the considerations (e.g., scale) that must be taken into account when choosing an appropriate map projection?  What are the differences between coordinate systems show in this map and when should (or shouldn't) we use them?

### Data Models

In Module 4, you assessed the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover and created a map that looked something like the image below.  Discuss the key differences between raster and vector data; what type(s) of phenomena they are best suited to represent, and what does the term 'resolution' describe in the context of these data models, and how is resolution related to, and different from, the concept of scale?  How did you make use of both raster and vector data to investigate the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover in Vancouver?

## Short Answer

You can answer these questions briefly in sentence or bullet point format.




### Raster Tools

Compare and contrast the raster calculator and weighted overlay tools.  Which of these tools (raster calculator or weighted overlay) did we use to identify the suitability Tsunami shelters in Port Alberni?  Could we have used the other tool (raster calculator or weighted overlay) instead?






### Vector Tools

Compare and contrast the clip and intersect tools.  Which of these tools (clip or intersect) did we use to identify the population at risk from a Tsunami in Port Alberni?  Could we have used the other tool (clip or intersect) instead?





### Autocorrelation

What is spatial auto-correlation and what are two analysis tools we covered that use spatial auto-correlation create a continuous field from discrete point observations?






### Select by Attribute

The table below contains a list records for different trees in an area.  The select by attribute tool can be used to query records in a table. For example, if I needed to find all the maple trees , I could select:\n\n<p><strong>Where:</strong> Species = Maple</p>








### File Size vs. Resolution
    
You have two raster images that cover the exact same area (same extent).  Raster image 'A' is a DEM (one band) and a cell size of 100 m.  Raster image 'B' is an RGB color image (three bands) and a cell size of 25 m.  If raster A has a file size of 10 mb (megabytes), what is the approximate file size of layer B in mb?",



You have two raster images that cover the exact same area (same extent).  Raster image 'A' is a DEM (one band) and a cell size of 100 m.  Raster image 'B' is an RGB color image (three bands) and a cell size of 50 m.  If raster A has a file size of 10 mb (megabytes), what is the approximate file size of layer B in mb?",





# Flowchart 

Create a flow chart to represent the analysis steps you would need to conduct to answer the following question. Either draw your flowchart by hand, use this [online tool](https://app.diagrams.net/), or use another software package (eg. power point, etc.) and upload it here. Use appropriate symbology to differentiate between layers (inputs/ intermediate layers /outputs) and processes and use arrows to connect them. You can include a written response as well to further explain steps/choices in your model if you wish.

* Save the file as either a .pdf, png, or jpg and name it as follows: **StudentNumber_Flowchart.pdf**
  * If your student number were "10011001", your file would be named: **10011001_FlowChart.pdf**, **10011001_FlowChart.png**, or **10011001_FlowChart.jpg**, depending on the file type you chose.
* Make sure to upload the flowchart as a separate file.  Do not include it in your written answers or it **will not be marked**.



### Locations for a Cherry Orchard

You have been hired as a GIS consultant to identify the best locations in BC to start a new organic cherry orchard. The ideal location must meet the following criteria:

* Be on land already used for agriculture.
* Precipitation must be greater than 500 mm/year but less than 1500 mm/year.
* Mean winter temperature must be less than 4 degrees but greater than -10 degrees.
* Greater than 250 m away from First or Second order streams.
* Within 50 km of a farmers market.

You have the following data to work with. Create a flowchart to show how you would go about identifying potential orchard locations.

# Mixed Questions

For these questions, download the answer sheet for your exam, which can be found [here](https://github.com/GEOS270/FinalExam/raw/main/sheets/0_AnswerSheet.zip).  

* It is **very important** make sure the file is named and formatted properly **before** you upload it.  
    * It should be formatted as follows: **StudentNumber_AnswerSheet.csv** .
