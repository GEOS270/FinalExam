* Consists of an essay and a handful of short answer questions

* For your written section, type up your essay and short answers response and save them **in one document** as .pdf.  Name the file: **StudentNumber_WrittenRespones.pdf**
* If your student number were "10011001", your file would be named: **10011001_WrittenRespones.pdf**

### Flowchart

* Create a flowchart outlining a geographic analysis you can use the [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) tool discussed in class, another software of your choosing, or draw one out by hand. 
* Save the file as either a .pdf, png, or jpg. Name the file: **StudentNumber_Flowchart.pdf**
  * If your student number were "10011001", your file would be named: **10011001_FlowChart.pdf**, **10011001_FlowChart.png**, or **10011001_FlowChart.jpg**, depending on the file type you chose.
* Make sure to upload the flowchart as a separate file.  Do not include it in your written answers or it will not be marked.

### Mixed Questions Types

Good Luck!


# Written Responses

## Essay

Pick **one** of the essays below to answer.  Make sure to list the number of the essay you are choosing to answer.  Feel free to include diagrams/figures/sketches if applicable, but do not feel obligated to do so.



### Coordinate Systems

In Module 2, you created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the steps necessary to create a 2D representation of the earth (or a specific region of the earth) in a GIS and what are the simplifications made at each step?  Discuss the considerations (e.g., scale) that must be taken into account when choosing an appropriate map projection?  What are the differences between coordinate systems show in this map and when should (or shouldn't) we use them?

### Data Models

In Module 4, you assessed the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover and created a map that looked something like the image below.  Discuss the key differences between raster and vector data; what type(s) of phenomena they are best suited to represent, and what does the term 'resolution' describe in the context of these data models, and how is resolution related to, and different from, the concept of scale?  How did you make use of both raster and vector data to investigate the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover in Vancouver?

## Short Answer

You can answer these questions briefly in sentence or bullet point format.




### Normalization


What is the purpose of data normalization and how do you do it? List two examples from lab where we normalized data and why we needed to do it?






### Vector Tools

Compare and contrast the clip and intersect tools.  Which of these tools (clip or intersect) did we use to identify the population at risk from a Tsunami in Port Alberni?  Could we have used the other tool (clip or intersect) instead?






### Spatial Similarity

In lecture I contrasted agricultural systems (e.g., a corn field) with natural systems (e.g., a tundra ecosystem) when describing how we measure similarity or dissimilarity across space.  What were the terms used to similarity or dissimilarity across space?  Which one would best describe a corn field and which would better describe a tundra ecosystem and why?






### Select by Attribute

The table below contains a list records for different trees in an area.  The select by attribute tool can be used to query records in a table. For example, if I needed to find all the maple trees , I could select:\n\n<p><strong>Where:</strong> Species = Maple</p>




How would you use the select by attribute tool in ArcGIS Pro to select all the dogwood and pine trees over 5 m tall from the table above? Write out the query as it would be structured in the select by attribute tool, you can see the text above for a hint on how to format your answer. How many records would your query return?


|   A   | B | C |
|-------|--:|--:|
|Dogwood|  5| 50|
|Dogwood|  6| 75|
|Pine   | 20| 35|
|Pine   | 25| 45|
|Oak    | 10| 30|
|Maple  | 35| 60|







### File Size vs. Resolution
    
You have two raster images that cover the exact same area (same extent).  Raster image 'A' is a DEM (one band) and a cell size of 100 m.  Raster image 'B' is an RGB color image (three bands) and a cell size of 25 m.  If raster A has a file size of 10 mb (megabytes), what is the approximate file size of layer B in mb?",







# Flowchart 

Create a flow chart to represent the analysis steps you would need to conduct to answer the following question. Either draw your flowchart by hand, use this [online tool](https://app.diagrams.net/) or use a software package (eg. power point, etc.) and upload it here. Use appropriate symbology to differentiate between layers (inputs/ intermediate layers /outputs) and processes and use arrows to connect them. You can include a written response as well to further explain steps/choices in your model if you wish.



### Locations for an Ecotourism Resort

An investor wishes to develop a new eco-tourism resort for wildlife sightseeing in Northern BC. You have been hired as a GIS consultant to identify several candidate areas for building the resort. The ideal location must meet the following criteria:

* Within 50 km of an air strip, but more than 15 km from one.
* Within wolf, grizzly bear, and caribou's geographic ranges.
* On privately owned land (i.e. not First Nations or Government).
* Within low slope areas (slope < 5%).
* Below 2000m elevation.

You have the following data to work with. Create a flowchart to show how you would go about identifying potential resort locations.



|     A      |   B   | C  |         D          |                            E                             |
