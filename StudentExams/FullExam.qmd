### Coordinate Systems

In Module 2, you created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the steps necessary to create a 2D representation of the earth (or a specific region of the earth) in a GIS and what are the simplifications made at each step?  Discuss the considerations (e.g., scale) that must be taken into account when choosing an appropriate map projection?  What are the differences between coordinate systems show in this map and when should (or shouldn't) we use them?

![](images/Coordinate_System_Comparison.png){width=80%}




### Answer

Earth > Geoid > Datum > Geographic Coordinate System (Lat/Lon) > Projection

* **Geoid** Smooths out topography, measure by satellites, models large scale (eg. continental) undulations of earths crust due to gravity differentials ( on the order of +/-180m)
* **Datum** - Oblate Speheroid fit to the geoid, Smooths out remaining elevation differences to create an 3D semi-spherical shape symmetric around the equator (equatorial bulge due to centrifugal force). Fit globally (to center of earth) or locally (surface of earth)

**Geographic Coordinate System (GCS)** - Assign a GCS (eg. Latitude & Longitude) to the datum
    * Relates locations on the earth's surface to the datum(spheroid)
    * Latitude & Longitude is a spherical coordinate system that uses degrees from the equator & prime meridian
    * Lat - equator +-90
    * Lon - prime meridian +-180
    * Not the only option, could use radians, but degrees are a bit easier to understand (an especially astute point if anyone mentions this)

**Projected Coordinate System** - Transforms the 3D GCS so that it can be displayed more effectively on a 2D map.

* Key difference is a 2D vs. 3D coordinate system 
    * Transforms the 3D GCS so that it can be displayed more effectively on a 2D map
    * 'Correcting' for curvature of the earth
    * Any calculations you do in a Lat/Lon will be in degrees and therefore meaningless (area, distance, etc).
* A map is a 2D entity so when you map unprotected data everything looks 'spaghettified' at the poles because we are not accounting for the convergence of meridians (lines of longitude) at the poles.
* All projections induce error, but in different ways some more/some less. **Must** consider the scale of the map **and** the application of the map.
* **Scale:**
    * Small scale maps = large area, large scale maps = small area
    * Counter to common understanding of term and easy to mix up.  Don't knock them too hard if the mix them up as long as they're logically consistent w/ the ideas.
* **Types:**
    * Cylindrical projections are generally best suited for small scale (i.e. global) applications.
    * Conic are well suited for hemispheric and regional applications in the mid-latitudes (eg. Mapping Canada or BC)
    * Azimuthal are good for the poles or a select few other applications (e.g. airports)
        * Didn't spend much time on these - they should mention for full credit, but don't knock too much if they can't explain it
    * Universal Transverse Mercator are good for large scale applications (eg. city of Vancouver)
* **Application**
    * Calculating area, **must** use an equal area projection for most scales, UTM is fine for large scale (eg. a city) application.
    * For small scale - if we need to follow bearings (navigation) or need shape to be maintained go with a conformal projection (eg. Mercator)
    * When we are only concerned for aesthetics, we can go with a compromise projection.

**The Map**:
    * WGS 1984 - not projected, should never use for a 2D map
    * Web Mercator - cylindrical conformal projection. Okay for global applications (eg. google maps) but causes sever distortions away from tangent line (the equator)
    * Lambert Conformal Conic - does a good job for Canada maintaining shape and minimizing most distortion, but not an equal area so won't give the best area calculations.
    * Albers Equal Area - visually not quit as nice as Lambert but gives true area calculations
        




### Data Models

In Module 4, you assessed the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover and created a map that looked something like the image below.  Discuss the key differences between raster and vector data; what type(s) of phenomena they are best suited to represent, and what does the term 'resolution' describe in the context of these data models, and how is resolution related to, and different from, the concept of scale?  How did you make use of both raster and vector data to investigate the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover in Vancouver?

![](images/Van_NDVI_Map.png){width=80%}




### Answer

**Raster**

* How - Grid of equally sized/spaced cell
* Attributes: **only one** value per cell
* Cell size determines resolution
    * Resolution is explicitly defined, unlike vector data where its more ambiguous.
* Scale (spatial coverage) determined by # of cells (columns x rows)
* Can stack raster bands to add multiple attribute values (eg. RGB image)

* Phenomena - Continuous Fields
    * Vary across space, every location has a value
    * Can work for discrete objects but generally less effective than vector
    * Continuous phenomena can have discrete/qualitative values (e.g. land use) or continuous/quantitative values (e.g. temperature)
* Computationally efficient for overlays
    * Raster math allows for easy calculations, algebraic expressions with layers
* Large data volumes, re-projecting can be computationally expensive

**Vector**

* How - Point, Line, or Polygon objects with attributes linked in separate table.
* Number of vertices (points composing lines/polygons) determines resolution
    * Less explicit than raster
* Scale (spatial coverage) determined by bounds (north south/east west extent)
* Essentially unlimited number of attributes per object
* Phenomena - Discrete Objects
    * Clearly defined measurable values
    * Can work for continuous phenomena but generally less effective than raster
* Efficient querying and lookup of values
* Overlays can be computationally expensive for larger layers
* Examples - any two are fine as long as they're correct - some folks will probably try to say things like DEM are vectors (its not!, deduct pts for that)

* Scale/resolution discussion: scale is a property of the map/analysis, resolution is a property of the data.
    * Resolution will dictate the scale of analysis we can conduct, scale will dictate desired resolution.
    * Raster resolution is easier/more straight forward to define > its the cell size - has a significant impact on data volume
    * File size increases **exponentially** with decreasing cell size, and linearly with increasing number of bands.
    * Larger files = longer processing times
    * Vector resolution is less straightforward > number of vertices in a polygon/line > not typically explicitly defined for a file, unlike cell size
    * Still impacts data volume > more vertices = larger file & longer processing times.

**Analysis in Module 4**

* NDVI was raster - used to identify green vegetation areas

* Census Data - vector used to give income/housing cost for various areas
    * Some folks will probably try to say things like census data are raster. Its not, deduct pts for that!

* Two approaches 
    - 1 zonal stats to "stamp" census data over raster data to get mean NDVI per census block.  Quick and easy but gives less info
    - 2 reclassify to ID green vegetation then convert NDVI to vector then intersect > summarize > join to get total green veg area per CT.  More involved but can also give us a bit more info





## Short Answer

You can answer these questions briefly in sentence or bullet point format.




### Normalization


What is the data normalization? When/why might you want do it? List two examples from lab where we normalized data and why we needed to do it?


### Answer

Normalizing, is the process of dividing one variable by another.  It can highlight patterns by calculating rates or ratios and changing units.  It is used to account for confounding relationships, Confounding variables can be correlated but do not have to be correlated. Examples from lab: Population density, % income on food, % green space, Kernel density (not strictly speaking normalization, but we'll count it). - could be other examples I'm forgetting **Two examples & explanations** necessary for full credit.





### Autocorrelation

What is spatial auto-correlation? What are two tools we covered that we can use to create a continuous field from discrete point observations of phenomena that exhibit positive spatial auto-correlation?


### Answer

The measure of similarity between objects across space.  Positive (clustering) - Negative (dispersed) - near zero (random).  It allows us to make some a key assumptions when representing spatial data (eg. spatial inferences) but also violates the key assumptions of many statistical models. An astute answer will mention Tobler's Law. - Examples - Kernel Density and Inverse Distance Weighting are the key ones I'm looking for - but they could list other examples for partial credit if they give a good explanation.  ie, the raster model is predicated on the assumption that a cell is representative of the area it covers (spatial auto correlation) - not a 'tool', but if they give a good explanation give partial credit for something like that.






### Spatial Patterns

In lecture I contrasted agricultural systems (e.g., a corn field) with natural systems (e.g., a tundra ecosystem) when describing how we measure similarity or dissimilarity across space.  What were the terms used to describe similarity or dissimilarity across space?  Which one would best describe a corn field and which would better describe a tundra ecosystem and why?


### Answer

Heterogeneity: Dissimilarity of phenomena across space. Homogeneity: Clustering of similar phenomena in space. Statistical tests often assumes homogeneity, but the natural world is typically heterogeneity (An astute point for full credit!).  Corn - homogenous, Tundra - heterogeneous.





### Vector Tools

Compare and contrast the clip and intersect tools.  Which of these tools (clip or intersect) did we use to identify the population at risk from a Tsunami in Port Alberni?  Could we have used the other tool (clip or intersect) instead?

### Answer

Clip - directional, only two inputs, used to cut down input by clip layer.  Intersect - non-directional, can take more than two inputs, cuts layers down by spatial overlap **and** merges attributes.  Used intersect, clip would have worked too though because we were only interested in the spatial relationship when identifying the inundation zone.





### Raster Tools

Compare and contrast the raster calculator and weighted overlay tools.  Which of these tools (raster calculator or weighted overlay) did we use to identify the suitability Tsunami shelters in Port Alberni?  Could we have used the other tool (raster calculator or weighted overlay) instead?


### Answer

Raster Calculator - Treats layers as variables in equation.  Weighted overlay - only for discrete variables, requires explicit definition/classification of inputs.  Can do similar things to calculator, but not all that calculator can do.  Used weighted overlay, could have used raster calculator instead.




### Select by Attribute

The table below contains a list records for different trees in an area.  The select by attribute tool can be used to query records in a table. For example, if I needed to find all the maple trees , I could select:\n\n<p><strong>Where:</strong> Species = Maple</p>




How would you use the select by attribute tool in ArcGIS Pro to select all the dogwood and pine trees over 5 m tall from the table above? Write out the query as it would be structured in the select by attribute tool, you can see the text above for a hint on how to format your answer. How many records would your query return?


|   Species   | Age | Height |
|-------|--:|--:|
|Dogwood|  5| 50|
|Dogwood|  6| 75|
|Pine   | 20| 35|
|Pine   | 25| 45|
|Oak    | 10| 30|
|Maple  | 35| 60|



### Answer

Where Species = Pine **And** Height > 5 **OR** Species = Dogwood **And** Height > 5
Returns 3 records
Variations are fine but must have proper use of the **or** If statement is wrong, but number of rows are correct, answer is insufficient give 2 pts. Half credit if they confuse records (rows) with attributes (columns)





How would you use the select by attribute tool in ArcGIS Pro to select all the birch and pine trees over 35 yr old from the table above? Write out the query as it would be structured in the select by attribute tool, you can see the text above for a hint on how to format your answer. How many records would your query return?


|   Species   | Age | Height |
|-----|--:|--:|
|Birch|  5| 50|
|Birch|  6| 75|
|Pine | 20| 35|
|Pine | 25| 45|
|Oak  | 10| 30|
|Maple| 35| 60|



### Answer

Where Species = Pine **And** Age > 35 **OR** Species = Birch **And** Age > 35
Returns 3 records
Variations are fine but must have proper use of the **or** If statement is wrong, but number of rows are correct, answer is insufficient give 2 pts. Half credit if they confuse records (rows) with attributes (columns)




### Resolution vs. File Size
    



You have two raster images that cover the exact same area (same extent).  Raster image 'A' is a DEM (one band) and a cell size of 100 m.  Raster image 'B' is an RGB color image (three bands) and a cell size of 25 m.  If raster A has a file size of 10 mb (megabytes), what is the approximate file size of layer B in mb?",


### Answer

**480 mb**

File size is linearly dependent on the number of bans and exponentially dependent upon the cell size

A 100m cell size, B 25 m cell size

B is 4x smaller than A: 100/25 = 4

One band of B is: 4<sup>2</sup> = 16 times lager; 16*10 mb = 160 mb

Since B has 3 bands: 160 mb * 3 bands = 480 mb






You have two raster images that cover the exact same area (same extent).  Raster image 'A' is a DEM (one band) and a cell size of 100 m.  Raster image 'B' is an RGB color image (three bands) and a cell size of 50 m.  If raster A has a file size of 10 mb (megabytes), what is the approximate file size of layer B in mb?",

### Answer

File size is linearly dependent on the number of bans and exponentially dependent upon the cell size

**120** mb


File size is linearly dependent on the number of bans and exponentially dependent upon the cell size

A 100m cell size, B 50 m cell size

B is 4x smaller than A: 100/50 = 2

One band of B is: 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 times lager; 4*10 mb = 40 mb

Since B has 3 bands: 40 mb * 3 bands = 120 mb
