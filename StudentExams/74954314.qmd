This is the final exam for student number: **74954314**.  Confirm your student number is correct before proceeding.  **Do not complete someone else's exam.** 


# Instructions

The exam is "open book", you can reference any resources from the class or online to work through the questions. However, all the work MUST be in your own words. You can not copy from online resources or classmates. Plagiarism will be taken very seriously and could result in failing the exam.

The exam will be open for 24 hours, but it shouldn't take you more than a few hours to complete.  You only have one attempt to take the exam during the exam.  The exam has **three parts**: a written response section, a flowchart section, and a mixed questions.  You will save each part as a separate document and upload it to exam page on canvas.

If you experience extenuating circumstances during the exam you may reach out to me, but I will not be answering any questions related to the content of the exam during the exam period. Do not contact your TAs about the exam, they will not be answering any questions during the exam period.

Good Luck!


# Written Responses

This section consists of an essay and a handful of short answer questions.

* For your written section, type up your essay and short answers response and save them **in one document** as .pdf.  Name the file: **StudentNumber_WrittenRespones.pdf**
    * If your student number were "10011001", your file would be named: **10011001_WrittenRespones.pdf**


## Essay

Pick **one** of the essays below to answer.  Make sure to list the number of the essay you are choosing to answer.  Feel free to include diagrams/figures/sketches if applicable, but do not feel obligated to do so.



### Coordinate Systems

In Module 2, you created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the steps necessary to create a 2D representation of the earth (or a specific region of the earth) in a GIS and what are the simplifications made at each step?  Discuss the considerations (e.g., scale) that must be taken into account when choosing an appropriate map projection?  What are the differences between coordinate systems show in this map and when should (or shouldn't) we use them?

### Data Models

In Module 4, you assessed the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover and created a map that looked something like the image below.  Discuss the key differences between raster and vector data; what type(s) of phenomena they are best suited to represent, and what does the term 'resolution' describe in the context of these data models, and how is resolution related to, and different from, the concept of scale?  How did you make use of both raster and vector data to investigate the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover in Vancouver?

## Short Answer

You can answer these questions briefly in sentence or bullet point format.





### Spatial Similarity

In lecture I contrasted agricultural systems (e.g., a corn field) with natural systems (e.g., a tundra ecosystem) when describing how we measure similarity or dissimilarity across space.  What were the terms used to similarity or dissimilarity across space?  Which one would best describe a corn field and which would better describe a tundra ecosystem and why?






### Normalization


What is the purpose of data normalization and how do you do it? List two examples from lab where we normalized data and why we needed to do it?






### Raster Tools

Compare and contrast the raster calculator and weighted overlay tools.  Which of these tools (raster calculator or weighted overlay) did we use to identify the suitability Tsunami shelters in Port Alberni?  Could we have used the other tool (raster calculator or weighted overlay) instead?






### Select by Attribute

The table below contains a list records for different trees in an area.  The select by attribute tool can be used to query records in a table. For example, if I needed to find all the maple trees , I could select:\n\n<p><strong>Where:</strong> Species = Maple</p>




How would you use the select by attribute tool in ArcGIS Pro to select all the birch and pine trees over 35 yr old from the table above? Write out the query as it would be structured in the select by attribute tool, you can see the text above for a hint on how to format your answer. How many records would your query return?


|  A  | B | C |
|-----|--:|--:|
|Birch|  5| 50|
|Birch|  6| 75|
|Pine | 20| 35|
|Pine | 25| 45|
|Oak  | 10| 30|
|Maple| 35| 60|







### File Size vs. Resolution
    
You have two raster images that cover the exact same area (same extent).  Raster image 'A' is a DEM (one band) and a cell size of 100 m.  Raster image 'B' is an RGB color image (three bands) and a cell size of 25 m.  If raster A has a file size of 10 mb (megabytes), what is the approximate file size of layer B in mb?",



You have two raster images that cover the exact same area (same extent).  Raster image 'A' is a DEM (one band) and a cell size of 100 m.  Raster image 'B' is an RGB color image (three bands) and a cell size of 50 m.  If raster A has a file size of 10 mb (megabytes), what is the approximate file size of layer B in mb?",





# Flowchart 

Create a flow chart to represent the analysis steps you would need to conduct to answer the following question. Either draw your flowchart by hand, use this [online tool](https://app.diagrams.net/), or use another software package (eg. power point, etc.) and upload it here. Use appropriate symbology to differentiate between layers (inputs/ intermediate layers /outputs) and processes and use arrows to connect them. You can include a written response as well to further explain steps/choices in your model if you wish.

* Save the file as either a .pdf, png, or jpg and name it as follows: **StudentNumber_Flowchart.pdf**
  * If your student number were "10011001", your file would be named: **10011001_FlowChart.pdf**, **10011001_FlowChart.png**, or **10011001_FlowChart.jpg**, depending on the file type you chose.
* Make sure to upload the flowchart as a separate file.  Do not include it in your written answers or it **will not be marked**.



### Locations for a New Blue Jays Stadium

The Toronto Blue Jays are considering replacing the Rogers Centre with a new stadium. You have been hired by the city of Toronto to identify candidate sites for the new Blue Jays stadium. The ideal location must meet the following criteria:

* On land zoned for commercial or industrial development.
* At least 300 m away from any heritage buildings.
* Within 1000 m of a subway stop served by Line 1 or 2.
* Within 500 m of an arterial roadway.
* Outside of flood-prone areas (flood probability < 10%).

You have the following data to work with. Create a flowchart to show how you would go about identifying potential stadium locations.



|        A         |   B   | C  |      D      |                             E                             |

# Mixed Questions

For these questions, download the answer sheet for your exam, which can be found [here](https://github.com/GEOS270/FinalExam/raw/main/sheets/0_AnswerSheet.zip).  

* It is **very important** make sure the file is named and formatted properly **before** you upload it.  
    * It should be formatted as follows: **StudentNumber_AnswerSheet.csv** .  
    * If your student number were "10011001", your file would be named: **10011001_AnswerSheet.csv**
  
* **Do not** upload the answer sheet as a .numbers, .xls, or any other type of file.   Only upload a .csv file for your answer sheet.
    * Canvas will convert .numbers, .xls, etc to a .pdf and which cannot be graded automatically.  
    * Answer sheets that cannot be graded automatically will incur a significant penalty.

* The answer sheet file is already named and formatted properly for you, but if you accidentally save in a different format need help exporting a .csv file, you can refer to the following instructions:
