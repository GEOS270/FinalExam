Feel free to include diagrams/figures/sketches if applicable, but do not feel obligated to do so.\n\nCoordinate Systems\nIn Module 2, you created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the steps necessary to create a 2D representation of the earth (or a specific region of the earth) in a GIS and what are the simplifications made at each step? Discuss the considerations (e.g., scale) that must be taken into account when choosing an appropriate map projection? What are the differences between coordinate systems show in this map and when should (or shouldn’t) we use them?\n\n\n\nData Models\nIn Module 4, you assessed the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover and created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the key differences between raster and vector data; what type(s) of phenomena they are best suited to represent, and what does the term ‘resolution’ describe in the context of these data models, and how is resolution related to, and different from, the concept of scale? How did you make use of both raster and vector data to investigate the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover in Vancouver?"

Feel free to include diagrams/figures/sketches if applicable, but do not feel obligated to do so.\n\nCoordinate Systems\nIn Module 2, you created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the steps necessary to create a 2D representation of the earth (or a specific region of the earth) in a GIS and what are the simplifications made at each step? Discuss the considerations (e.g., scale) that must be taken into account when choosing an appropriate map projection? What are the differences between coordinate systems show in this map and when should (or shouldn’t) we use them?\n\n\n\nData Models\nIn Module 4, you assessed the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover and created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the key differences between raster and vector data; what type(s) of phenomena they are best suited to represent, and what does the term ‘resolution’ describe in the context of these data models, and how is resolution related to, and different from, the concept of scale? How did you make use of both raster and vector data to investigate the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover in Vancouver?"

Discuss the steps necessary to create a 2D representation of the earth (or a specific region of the earth) in a GIS and what are the simplifications made at each step? Discuss the considerations (e.g., scale) that must be taken into account when choosing an appropriate map projection? What are the differences between coordinate systems show in this map and when should (or shouldn’t) we use them?\n\n\n\nData Models\nIn Module 4, you assessed the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover and created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the key differences between raster and vector data; what type(s) of phenomena they are best suited to represent, and what does the term ‘resolution’ describe in the context of these data models, and how is resolution related to, and different from, the concept of scale? How did you make use of both raster and vector data to investigate the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover in Vancouver?"

Feel free to include diagrams/figures/sketches if applicable, but do not feel obligated to do so.\n\nCoordinate Systems\nIn Module 2, you created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the steps necessary to create a 2D representation of the earth (or a specific region of the earth) in a GIS and what are the simplifications made at each step? Discuss the considerations (e.g., scale) that must be taken into account when choosing an appropriate map projection? What are the differences between coordinate systems show in this map and when should (or shouldn’t) we use them?\n\n\n\nData Models\nIn Module 4, you assessed the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover and created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the key differences between raster and vector data; what type(s) of phenomena they are best suited to represent, and what does the term ‘resolution’ describe in the context of these data models, and how is resolution related to, and different from, the concept of scale? How did you make use of both raster and vector data to investigate the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover in Vancouver?"

Feel free to include diagrams/figures/sketches if applicable, but do not feel obligated to do so.\n\nCoordinate Systems\nIn Module 2, you created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the steps necessary to create a 2D representation of the earth (or a specific region of the earth) in a GIS and what are the simplifications made at each step? Discuss the considerations (e.g., scale) that must be taken into account when choosing an appropriate map projection? What are the differences between coordinate systems show in this map and when should (or shouldn’t) we use them?\n\n\n\nData Models\nIn Module 4, you assessed the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover and created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the key differences between raster and vector data; what type(s) of phenomena they are best suited to represent, and what does the term ‘resolution’ describe in the context of these data models, and how is resolution related to, and different from, the concept of scale? How did you make use of both raster and vector data to investigate the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover in Vancouver?"

What were the terms used to describe similarity or dissimilarity across space? Which one would best describe a corn field and which would better describe a tundra ecosystem and why?\n\n\nRaster Tools\nCompare and contrast the raster calculator and weighted overlay tools. Which of these tools (raster calculator or weighted overlay) did we use to identify the suitability Tsunami shelters in Port Alberni?

Feel free to include diagrams/figures/sketches if applicable, but do not feel obligated to do so.\n\nCoordinate Systems\nIn Module 2, you created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the steps necessary to create a 2D representation of the earth (or a specific region of the earth) in a GIS and what are the simplifications made at each step? Discuss the considerations (e.g., scale) that must be taken into account when choosing an appropriate map projection? What are the differences between coordinate systems show in this map and when should (or shouldn’t) we use them?\n\n\n\nData Models\nIn Module 4, you assessed the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover and created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the key differences between raster and vector data; what type(s) of phenomena they are best suited to represent, and what does the term ‘resolution’ describe in the context of these data models, and how is resolution related to, and different from, the concept of scale? How did you make use of both raster and vector data to investigate the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover in Vancouver?"

Discuss the steps necessary to create a 2D representation of the earth (or a specific region of the earth) in a GIS and what are the simplifications made at each step? Discuss the considerations (e.g., scale) that must be taken into account when choosing an appropriate map projection? What are the differences between coordinate systems show in this map and when should (or shouldn’t) we use them?\n\n\n\nData Models\nIn Module 4, you assessed the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover and created a map that looked something like the image below. Discuss the key differences between raster and vector data; what type(s) of phenomena they are best suited to represent, and what does the term ‘resolution’ describe in the context of these data models, and how is resolution related to, and different from, the concept of scale? How did you make use of both raster and vector data to investigate the relationship between housing cost and vegetation cover in Vancouver?"
